Her passions lie in mental health advocacy for people of color and giving a voice for AAPI, especially through her blog, napkinhoarder.com, where she writes about her own Asian American experience and growing up with immigrant parents. Phyllis is a survivor who battles her depression on a daily basis. Through much encouragement and support from friends and her faith community, she began her journey through therapy and medication to fight her depression. Her biggest hurdle has been rising out of shame and misinformation of mental health illnesses, especially in the AAPI community. After sharing her story, she has been able to help others to battle their own mental health illnesses, shame and misinformation as well as being able to speak truth of their worth and value

		        				Emily Wu Truong (吳怡萱), also known as “Lady in Green,” is nationally-recognized speaker for mental health awareness from the San Gabriel Valley of Los Angeles. She is a Motivational Speaker & Mental Health Advocate, holding a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology & Social Behavior from UC Irvine. On July 29, 2013 during a Legislative Briefing on Asian American Mental Health in Rosemead, CA, Emily stated, “I will not end my life because I have a story to share. The more we talk about mental health, the more we will alleviate the stigma. There is no shame. There is no shame.” That day marked the beginning of Emily’s journey of grassroots advocacy to alleviate the stigma on mental health in her community. As an outspoken advocate, Emily works with numerous campaigns, mental health organizations and committees. She serves as a spokeswoman for the California Mental Health Movement “Each Mind Matters,” is the Vice President of Multicultural Outreach on the Board of Directors of NAMI San Gabriel Valley, serves as the Chair of the Asian Coalition, and is a member of the Client & Family Leadership Committee for the Mental Health Services Oversight & Accountability Commission (MHSOAC) in Sacramento. As a motivational speaker, Emily has transformed her story of growing up with depression to a story of self-acceptance to inspire others to also recognize the infinite value of their own lives and find meaning in life struggles. She utilizes her story to portray mental health as a transformative means towards self-actualization, self-empowerment and understanding one’s capacity to become emotionally resilient. She has been invited to speak at UC Berkeley, USC, UCLA, UC Irvine, Raytheon (https://goo.gl/UT05t1), and for Epoch Times, L.A. Care Health Plan and International Bipolar Foundation (http://goo.gl/SLpgba). She is best known for her speeches “Believing in Me: My Journey to Finding My Self-Worth,” “Breaking Down the Walls of Perfectionism” and “Coping with Stigma & Discrimination: How I Became a Stronger Mental Health Advocate.” In recognition of Emily’s heartfelt efforts to alleviate the stigma around mental illness (https://goo.gl/Kx0xC9), Emily was the honoree for Senator Ed Hernandez’s 2015 Woman of the Year Award and the 2015 Youth & Young Adult Peer Leadership Award at the 29th Annual National Alternatives Conference held in Memphis, Tennessee. Emily’s community outreach efforts have also been recognized by Congresswoman Grace Napolitano, Co-Chair of the Congressional Mental Health Caucus. Emily has become a role model, demonstrating self-initiative and an indomitable will, delivering her message that with help, there is hope.
